# Diabetes prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project explores the relationship between age, blood glucose levels, and diabetes status using health data. The dataset includes information about gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes.



## Objectives

The main objective is to investigate how age and blood glucose levels may be associated with diabetes occurrence.


## Methods

The analysis involves data exploration, visualization with scatter plots, and statistical summaries. Naive Bayes and logistic regression models are used to study potential associations.
## Outcome
Insights from this project may identify risk factors and patterns relevant for healthcare decisions and disease prevention strategies.
## Dependencies

-Python (3.x)

-pandas (data manipulation)

-matplotlib and seaborn (data visualization)

-scikit-learn (machine learning)
